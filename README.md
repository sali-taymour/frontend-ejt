### publish a Node/Express/API at Heroku and a Vite-React site at Netlify dealing with the issue of getting the environment variables set correctly locally * (in the .env file) and online (as environment variables on the Heroku and Netlify providers) so that the local frontend automatically uses the local     * backend and the online Netlify frontend automatically uses the online Heroku backend       
* this project consists of two code bases:    
* a backend Node/Express API which serves data fetched from various sources   
* a f rontend React site which fetches its data from the backend
* set up this project so that it works locally
*  publish the backend at Heroku
*  test with Postman
*  test with local frontend
*  publish the frontend at Netlify
*  enable online frontend to fetch data from online backend
